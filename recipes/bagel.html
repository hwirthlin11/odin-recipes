    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Make bagels: Combine water, flour, sugar, salt, vegetable oil, and yeast
        in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook. Mix on low
        speed until dough is well-developed, about 8 minutes. To ensure the
        gluten has developed fully, cut off a walnut-sized piece of dough. Flour
        your fingers, and then stretch the dough: if it tears immediately, the
        dough needs more kneading. Fully developed dough should form a thin
        translucent "windowpane."
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer dough to a lightly oiled bowl, cover it with plastic wrap and a
        kitchen towel, and let rise for 2 hours.
      </li>
      <li>
        Punch dough down, place it on a lightly floured work surface, and use a
        knife or dough scraper to divide the dough into 6 pieces (or more, for
        smaller bagels). Roll each piece of dough into a sausage shape about 6
        inches long. Join the ends to form a circle. Repeat with the remaining
        dough, and let the bagels rest for 15 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 475 degrees F (245 degrees C). Line a baking sheet
        with parchment paper. Arrange small plates with poppy seeds, sesame
        seeds, and onion flakes next to the baking sheet.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bring 4 quarts of water to a boil in a large pot. Add honey, if desired
        (see Editor's Note). Boil three bagels at a time, until they rise to the
        surface of the pot, about 1 minute per side. Remove bagels with a
        slotted spoon and place them on the lined baking sheet.
      </li>
      <li>
        Dip the tops of the wet bagels into the toppings and arrange them, seed-side up, on the baking sheet. Sprinkle with coarse salt, if desired.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until the bagels begin to brown, 15 to 20 minutes.
      </li>
