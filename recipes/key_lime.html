    <p>
      This key lime pie recipe is made with condensed milk and sour cream.
      Fabulously easy and a summertime favorite! If you have time, a homemade
      graham cracker crust is better. Garnish with whipped cream and thin slices
      of lime if you like.

    <!-- Ingredients -->
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>3 cups sweetened condensed milk</li>
      <li>¾ cup key lime juice</li>
      <li>½ cup sour cream</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon grated lime zest</li>
      <li>1 (9 inch) prepared graham cracker crust</li>
    </ul>
    <!-- Instructions -->
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
      <li>
        Combine condensed milk, key lime juice, sour cream, and lime zest in a
        bowl; mix well. Pour into graham cracker crust; place pie on a baking
        sheet.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven for 5 to 8 minutes, until tiny pinhole
        bubbles burst on the surface of the pie. The filling will be wobbly but
        not browned.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer pie to a wire rack to cool, then thoroughly chill pie in the
        refrigerator before serving, about 1 hour. Garnish with lime slices and
        whipped cream, if desired.
      </li>
      <li>
        Reduce heat, and season with remaining 1 teaspoon garam masala and
        cayenne. Stir in a few spoonfuls of sauce, and simmer until liquid has
        reduced, and chicken is no longer pink. Add cooked chicken into sauce
        and stir together.
